# SpectralCorr

Power-spectrum based significance testing for autocorrelated time series. This Python package implements a non-parametric correlation test that utilizes randomly generated time series with the appropriate power spectra (Ebisuzaki, 1997). The correlation test is applied here both to instantaneous and lagged correlations.
