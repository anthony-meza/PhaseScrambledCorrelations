Power-spectrum based correlation significance testing for autocorrelated time series. This Python package implements a non-parametric correlation test that utilizes randomly generated time series with the appropriate power spectra (Ebisuzaki, 1997). The Ebisuzaki correlation test can be applied here to test both lagged and non-lagged correlations. 


## Installation

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/anthonymeza/SpectralCorr.git@main
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
import numpy as np
from SpectralCorr import AR1_process, cross_correlation

# Generate two AR(1) time series
ts1 = AR1_process(rho=0.9, sigma=1.0, y0=0.0, N=500, seed=42)
ts2 = AR1_process(rho=0.8, sigma=1.0, y0=0.0, N=500, seed=123)

# Compute cross-correlation with Pearson method (no autocorrelation in timeseries)
result_pearson = cross_correlation(ts1, ts2, maxlags=50, method='pearson')

# Or use the Ebisuzaki method for robust significance testing for autocorrelated timeseries 
result_ebisuzaki = cross_correlation(ts1, ts2, maxlags=50, method='ebisuzaki', n_iter=1000)

# Results are returned as xarray Datasets
print(result_ebisuzaki.cross_correlation)
print(result_ebisuzaki.cross_correlation_pvalue)
```
